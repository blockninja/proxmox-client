# Proxmox Go Client

[![](https://godoc.org/github.com/blockninja/proxmox-client?status.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/blockninja/proxmox-client)

This is an partial implementation of Proxmox's REST API in Go.

It allows a client to provision VMs, LXC containers and storages.

It is in an unfinished state, released as opensource in the hopes that it helps someone out there in the world of hypervisors.
